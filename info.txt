Gamepasses (https://war-tycoon-roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Gamepasses):

Gamepasses inside War Tycoon can vary greatly in price and effectiveness. From a faster oil extractor to an explosive sniper capable of destroying everything and everyone in its path to boosting your shield's HP. There are a lot of game passes offered. This page was created to help you find the best gamepasses, which ones you are most interested in, and to give a brief summary of each one.

Speedy Oil Extractor
The Speedy Oil Extractor is one of the best game-changers for starting out. It is located on the ground floor at the back of the oil rig room. It gives $20 every second, making it very effective when starting out.

Rating: 7/10. Highly recommended for early games, as it can turn a slow start into a breeze. It may not be as useful if you have the capture point or when you are progressing later in the Tycoon since it will be providing a minority of your total cash income rate.

Description: "An automated Oil Extractor that runs significantly quicker than the standard ones."

2x cash
The 2x Cash doubles all of your income. It will double all income from the Oil Rigs, the objective's passive bonus, the oil barrel's sell price, and the money earned per kill as well. This gamepass also stacks with any additional money multipliers you have.

Rating: 9/10 This is one of the strongest gamepasses in War Tycoon, due to its doubling of all income. However, its price may be seen as a negative.

Description: "Make double the money. This will make you get double the cash from your oil tractors, capture point income, oil barrels, and cash per kill."

Desert Eagle
The Desert Eagle is the strongest pistol in the game. It deals huge amounts of damage, is a very powerful weapon and is overall fun to use. It has a lower ammo capacity than the other pistols and a slower fire rate, but that doesn't outweigh the very high damage.

Rating: 7/10 It is hard to use for longer ranges and has harsh recoil. It is rewarding to use despite its shortcomings.

Description: "A powerful 50-caliber pistol that deals a lot of damage with high recoil if you don't control its fire rate."

Fal Heavy
The FAL Heavy is hands-down the best assault rifle in the entire game. Dealing huge amounts of damage and having a rather fast fire rate. It is one of the most powerful guns in the game. The FAL does possess high recoil, potentially making it more difficult to use.

Rating: 9/10 The FAL is an all-around very versatile weapon, capable of killing people from both close and farther ranges. With a Low Price and high damage. The High recoil can be seen as a negative for some.

Description: "A powerful automatic rifle that deals a lot of damage with a very long range."

Explosive Sniper
The Explosive Sniper is the most powerful weapon in the game, capable of killing people instantly without the ability to revive due to its explosive damage. It can one shot headshot every level of armor and one shot the torso level 2 armor and below. Though it used to deal more damage, it is still very powerful and the best weapon to use against vehicles.

Rating: 6/10 This weapon can absolutely decimate not just players but also, in lots of cases, vehicles, including helicopters! However, it has been nerfed a lot through it's history and is not efficient for it's price tag.

Description: "A golden sniper that shoots Explosive bullets! ðŸ’¥"

2x Health Armor
The 2x Health Armor is pretty straight-forward. Equipping it will double your HP, raising it up from 100 to 200. This is the best armor out of all and can make you survive even sniper headshots.

Rating: 10/10 It' s low price plus doubling of your health make it 100% Recommended for purchase.

Description: "Raises your maximum health to 200. The default health is 100."

Speedy Humvee
The Speedy Humvee is the fastest car in the game. It can reach up speeds up to 125 mph and is very useful for traversing the map.

Rating: 7/10 A good, high-speed vehicle but is difficult to control, leaving this vehicle undesirable to some players.

Description: "Speed through the map with a modded Humvee!"

Mi-28 Havoc
Rating: 8/10 The Mi28 Havoc is one of the most powerful helicopters currently in the game, thanks to its versatility with 3 different missile types and a really good explosive cannon. The Mi-28 can also take damage since it has the second highest HP, the first being the Super Stallion. Overall, it's an all-rounder when it comes to ground and air, although air-to-air combat is where you truly shine.

Description: "A powerful helicopter that has 3 different missile types and a explosive machine gun!."

Abrams X Tank
The AbramsX tank is arguably one of, if not the best, tanks in the game. Having the second highest health of all the tanks, not so experienced people may not decide to mess around this tank due to it's capabilities to shred them in milliseconds. It's weapons include:

1x Explosive Cannon

1x 120mm Tank Cannon

1x Javelin

2x Double-Barrelled Drone Launchers

1x Coaxial Machine Gun

Rating: 7/10 It is a very effective vehicle to use, but it can fall weak to some of the more advanced tanks in the game, like the KF-51 Panther or M3 Bradley. However, if used correctly, you can be unstoppable!

Description:

"A Powerful and Fast Tank!

Tank Weapons:

Javelin Lock-On Launcher

120mm Tank Cannon

30mm Explosive Cannon

Coaxial Machine Gun

All weapons are controlled by the driver!"

Boxer CRV
The Boxer CRV is a heavy, slow vehicle located in the garage. It possesses the highest health of any ground vehicle in the game and has a mounted turret that can only be used by the driver.

Rating: 5/10 It is a very good vehicle but it's large size makes it difficult to navigate throughout the City without getting stuck in the tank traps. It really falls short to tanks, which will almost immediately annihilate this

Description: "An armored vehicle with a mounted turret that can be controlled by the driver."

10,000 Shield Health
The 10,000 Shield Health gamepass provides a substantial upgrade over the standard max shield health of 4000. However, all previous shield upgrades must be unlocked before unlocking of the 10,000 Shield Health Gamepass. This gamepass also makes all shield repairs free but lacks the ability to block a nuke.

Rating: 4.5/10: Provides much greater protection for you against simple attacks and raids. Shield repairs being made free is a greatly welcome bonus. However, the shield will still not last forever, especially when being attacked by helicopters and planes and its inability to block nukes makes it have some hefty downsides.

Description: "Increases the health of your base shield to 10,000 and makes shield repair free!"

JLTV
JLTV 2024 icon
The JTLV is located in the garage and shows many similarities to the Gurkha APC. It possesses a mounted HE chain gun on top of the vehicle, which can turn 360 degrees and with it also has a normal machine gun. It is the second vehicle to have Javlin's mounted, as it has not one but two to use against any ground vehicles it can see. It has moderately high HP and a fast top speed. It can prove an effective vehicle for raiding and a great no-part alternative to eradicate any ground vehicles and even a few tanks with a skilled user

Rating: 6/10 - the JTLV can prove to be of good value with high top speed, health, and an effective chaingun and is unique with its Javelin's. However, the JLTV can be destroyed with a single tank shell, leading to a stealthy playstyle against highly armored units.

Description: "Armored Vehicle With Driver-Controlled Weapons!"

Barrett M82 Sniper Rifle
Barrett Gamepass
The Barrett Sniper Rifle is one of the most powerful snipers in the game. It can shoot every armor level to the head and has a slow fire rate. It possess the highest zoom magnification out of all scoped weapons. It does become extremely inaccurate when moving around, on the other hand, which you will need to do a lot in sniper battles.

Rating: 6/10 It is a very powerful sniper rifle but it can prove challenging to use as you will need to stand still to properly hit your shots and the average player may not be able to achieve that.

Description: "A powerful sniper with a steady scope. The Barrett M82 is available in your Bunker once you have enough Rebirths to unlock it."



WW2 US Army Pack
WW2 pack
The WW2 pack is the only gamepass in the entire game, which includes multiple items. It contains the US Army Uniform, the M1 Garand, and the WW2 2x Health vest. The 2x Health Vest included in this pack works the same as the standard 2x Health Vest, leaving it as a simple remodel. The M1 Garand, on the other hand, is a very powerful rifle. It has a low ammo capacity but very high damage, making it a good rifle of choice.

Rating: 8/10 The WW2 pack is of very good value, with a version of the 2x Health Armor and an additional gun and uniform. However, said content is only unlocked after 4 rebirths, making it unavailable to starting players. Additionally, the styling of the 2x Health Armor might not be for everyone, and some might prefer the standard version over this WW2-themed one.

Description: "The US Army Pack includes 3 items: the legendary M1 Garand, US Army uniform, 2x Health WW2 Vest and M1 Helmet."



Destroyer Drone
Destroyer Drone Icon
The Destroyer Drone is a large, powerful drone that holds 2 machine guns and a grenade launcher. It can deal high damage and will be able to hunt your enemies due to its high amount of health and large battery size, which allows you to fly for minutes before running out. It can, however, fall short to the missile drone in terms of destroying infantry in pressured times.

Rating: 6/10 It is a decently effective drone, against low-level and high-level players alike. However, it can be countered easily if somebody is prepared. The Destroyer Drone is noteworthy, but it does have to compete with the missile drone, which can also get the job done pretty easily. Quite expensive for it's uses.

Description: "A heavy-duty drone with a lot of health and a long-lasting battery. The Destroyer Drone has 2 Machine Guns and a secondary Grenade Launcher! You will need 5 Rebirths to be able to use this Drone."



Custom Camo
Custom Camo Gamepass Icon
The Custom Camo Gamepass is a neat addition to anyone who likes to add some personal touch into their lives. It allows you to customize the colors of weapon camos to anything you like.

Rating: 5/10 While it doesn't give any gameplay advantage, it is a really neat way to customize your guns to your liking.

Description: "Customize the Color of your Weapons Camo!"



Auto Collect
Autocollect
The Auto Collect Gamepass is a convenient feature in War Tycoon that saves players time and effort. With this gamepass, players no longer need to physically walk over to the cash button to collect their earnings. Instead, the cash is automatically deposited directly into their wallet.

Rating: 6/10 While it doesn't give any gameplay advantage, it is significantly beneficial to players, especially if you are AFK grinding, and in the event that you disconnect, you still get all the cash. It may also be useful for people who are normally not in their base.

Description: "Automatically Collects Your Cash! (You can turn it on or off through the in-game settings."

F-35 Lightning II
F-35 Gamepass
The F-35 Lightning is an aircraft that is very maneuverable and was the first to introduce VTOL into the game. With such power comes a skill curve, making it challenging for newbie pilots to be able to use the F-35 to its full potential. For players who are able to, they are rewarded with the great arsenal the aircraft carries, being able to decimate any aircraft in its path within seconds thanks to its cannon and missiles.

Rating: 8/10 This gamepass is very powerful but requires a great deal of skill to be utilized to its fullest, so the user must make sure they are prepared or they might regret their purchase.

Description: "Powerful plane with VTOL!"

USS Zumwalt
USS Zumwalt Gamepass 
The USS Zumwalt is a monstrously large guided missile destroyer capable of mass destruction wherever it may be, Being the largest ship available in war tycoon this terror of the sea can unleash an arsenal unparraleled by any other with its 20 Missiles capable of decimating any vehicle in its path or using its two 155mm cannons the USS Zumwalt is force to be reckoned with. It also has an AI drone capable of launching missiles and 2 AI turrets for any aircraft in range. the USS Zumwalt is a large and strong target and takes a challenge to be beat.

Rating: 9/10 This gamepass is very strong but the zumwalt is a relatively slow and huge target, though it does have a lot of HP to combat this. The Zumwalt is also fit for any kind of player may it be a casual player or one trying to take power over an entire server with their sheer might and firepower.

Description: "Advanced Warship!"
